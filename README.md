# Tracking-Tracker
Tired of wasted food and money? This Python app tracks expiry dates for anything! Born from a college project, it lets you add items, assign storage, and see countdowns. Built with Tkinter and SQL, your data is saved safely. Track food, bills, assignments—never miss a deadline again!

We’ve all been there—that forgotten cheese hiding in the fridge, or the groceries you bought and never used. This app started as a Python school project, built with sheer will (and maybe a few lost hairs) to solve one simple problem: wasted stuff is wasted money.

With this visual tracker, you can:

· 🧾 Create items with expiry dates
· 📦 Organize them into storage bars (like “Fridge” or “Pantry”)
· 🗑️ Drag items to the trash when done—and restore or empty them in one click
· 💾 Import/export your database for backup or sharing

🔄 How it works

1. Click Add Bar to create a storage space.
2. Click Add Item to log anything with a deadline—yes, food, bills, homework, even anniversaries!
3. Drag items onto a bar to organize. If it doesn’t snap, try getting closer to the bar.
4. Trash something? Use the right-click menu on the trash bin to Undo All or Empty All (careful—no single-item undo!).

📊 Info panel updates automatically when items are placed in a bar. Click Refresh after clearing trash to keep everything in sync.

⚙️ Under the hood

· Made with Python + Tkinter, powered by SQL so your data persists even after closing.
· Use the File menu to run tests, clear memory (requires restart), or manage your database.

Remember: this isn’t just a food tracker—it’s your visual deadline companion. Use it wisely, waste less ✨
